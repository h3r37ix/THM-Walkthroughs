# Task 1: Web App Testing and Privilege Escalation
## Questions:
        1. Deploy the machine and connect to our network.
        2. Find the services exposed by the machine.
        3. What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?
        4. User brute-forcing to find the username & password
        5. What is the username?
        6. What is the password?
        7. What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?
        8. Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation
        9. What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)?
        10. If you have found another user, what can you do with this information?
        11. What is the final password you obtain?

  The Nmap Scan shows we have a few ports open. We can see there is the SSH port, an HTTP port, and two ports related to SMB.

### Question 3: What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server (enter name without /)?

  Our Gobuster scan uncovered /development. Let's see what is in there!

This little note further confirms the use of SMB, we can take a look at that. Also, it seems that password complexity may be lacking.
