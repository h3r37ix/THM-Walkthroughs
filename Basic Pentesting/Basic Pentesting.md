# Task 1: Web App Testing and Privilege Escalation
## Questions:
        1. Deploy the machine and connect to our network.
        2. Find the services exposed by the machine.
        3. What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?
        4. User brute-forcing to find the username & password
        5. What is the username?
        6. What is the password?
        7. What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?
        8. Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation
        9. What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)?
        10. If you have found another user, what can you do with this information?
        11. What is the final password you obtain?

### Question 1: Deploy the machine and connect to our network.
---
        No Answer.
### Question 2: Find the services exposed by the machine.

  The Nmap Scan shows we have a few ports open. We can see there is the SSH port, an HTTP port, and two ports related to SMB.

### Question 3: What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server (enter name without /)?

  Our Gobuster scan uncovered /development. Let's see what is in there!

  This little note further confirms the use of SMB, we can take a look at that. Also, it seems that password complexity may be lacking.

  A little SMB enumeration using SMBMap and we find a share named Anonymous

![Basic Pentesting/img/smbmap.png](https://github.com/h3r37ix/THM-Walkthroughs/blob/main/Basic%20Pentesting/img/smbmap.png)

  Connecting with SMBClient we can see a text file called staff.txt. Let's pull that and see what is inside.

  Staff.txt gives us full usernames! Jan and Kay

### Question 4: User brute-forcing to find the username & password.
---

To brute force, we can use Hydra. We know we have two names and the information we have gathered points us to try to gain access to Jan's account.

![Basic Pentesting/img/hydra.png](https://github.com/h3r37ix/THM-Walkthroughs/blob/main/Basic%20Pentesting/img/hydra.png)

  A quick brute force with hydra and we get Jan's password.

### Question 5: What is the username?
---

  Jan

### Question 6: What is the password?
---

  armando

### Question 7: What service do you use to access the server (answer in abbreviation in all caps)?
---

  To access the server with the credentials we found, we would use SSH.

### Question 8: Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation
---

  To find vectors to escalate our privileges, we will use Linpeas. Looking through the Linpeas output we see some interesting files that we may be able to take a look at.

  Navigating to Kay's profile, we can access her .ssh folder, and take her SSH private key! We can pull that private off and use SSH2John to pull the hash. Once we have the hash, we can run it through John the Ripper to get the passphrase for the Private Key.

![Basic Pentesting/img/john.png](https://github.com/h3r37ix/THM-Walkthroughs/blob/main/Basic%20Pentesting/img/john.png)

We now have the passphrase to use the private key for Kay.

### Question 9: What is the name of the other user you found (all lower case)?
---

  kay

### Question 10: If you have found another user, what can you do with this information?
---
  
 No Answer

### Question 11: What is the final password you obtain?
---

  In Kay's user folder we can see a file named pass.bak. A quick cat command and we have the final password!
